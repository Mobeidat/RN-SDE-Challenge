## MAF React Native Assessment

Hi there! We are happy you are interested in joining the React Native engineering team here at MAF Digital Labs.

The fowllowing excercises are to determine your coding knowledge and skills.

For this project, we would require you to use React Native CLI.


### Before you start 

1. Create a new github repository, it's important that you don't do Merge Requests to this repository, you will do it over your own new created repository.

2. Every Coding Challenge should be one open Merge Request. At the end of finishing this project you will have one open Merge Request per Coding Challenge. If your code depends on other Merge Request you will point the merge request to the dependant branch instead of `master`.

3. Then after finishing all challenges you need to share the link with moathalobeidat@gmail.com


### Challenges

We want to convert the design you find on https://bit.ly/3dKLZ6u into interactive and responsive experience. Pay attendtion to the details. 


#### Challenge 1 - Mock-up slicing & Data

Design - https://bit.ly/3dKLZ6u

For the Vegetables list, create a json file with any dummy data to consume it dynamically in your application, like item name, item description and item images.

#### Challenge 2 - App Flow

As a React Native Developer, you should be able to understand and implement a multiple stacks navigatior.

1. You should be able to create a bottom tab navigator (Screens that are not provided in the design should be replaced with an empty screen). 
2. You should be able to create a conditional rendered stacks based on auth status.


#### Challenge 3 - Micro-Interactions

It's time for the Micro-interactions

On the design you will find a menu button (three dots) on the menu, when you click that button it should open a side menu, the transition between openinig and closing the menu should be animated, please go creative and use whatever you think will work.


### Delivery of the project

After you finish your project, please share the outcomes and the github repository of the project with moathalobeidat@gmail.com
